# Talk Abstract

# Talk Description

`Free` is something I've wanted to understand for quite a while, but could never quite figure it out. I’d essentially given up on it until a friend of mine, known to be particularly fond of pithy statements, told me _`Free` is merely the defunctionalisation of Monad in its most uncomfortable configuration_. He didn’t add _what’s the problem?_ but it was clearly implied.

The odd thing though is that after playing with this for a bit, it turned out to be exactly what I needed to hear to get me unstuck.

This talk is my slightly expanded version of that statement, and should hopefully understand what `Free` is, what purpose it serves and where it came from.
